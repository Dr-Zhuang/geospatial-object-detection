Considering the practical applications especially in military field, five categories are selected to be annotated, including plane, helicopter, oiltank, airport and warship. Finally, we construct a large-scale remote sensing dataset for geospatial object detection, which totally contains 18,187 color images with multiple resolutions from multiple platforms like Google Earth. There are 40,990 well-annotated instances in the dataset. The width of each image is mostly about 300~600 pixels. To increase the diversity of samples, we collect these remote-sensing images from different places at different times.
